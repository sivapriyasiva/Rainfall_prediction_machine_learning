Introduction
=============
	In this project I have trained in Tamilnadu state district wise data. User can choose any district in Tamilnadu and enter any date the model was predict this 
particular district and specific date rainfall or not. The dataset is taken from National Aeronautics and space Administration (NASA)/ Goddard Space Flight Center. 

	Dataset used has a total of 8 parameters includes, Year, Month, Day, Location, UV_index (Ultra violet index), Temperature, Humidity, Wind_pressure.  

	The project to predict future level and current prediction also because, current prediction is the parameter comparision
to predict today rainfall or not is the result was more accrately predicted. addictionally, used on range based rainfall
prediction actually, this is the output of this project( run to date__range.py file). to Analysis various cases and best fit calculated
then graphically represented. 
	


Problem statement
================

	The current problem is that the government has announced a school closure due to rainfall, but there is no rainfall in the area. 
This can be attributed to the inaccurate prediction of rainfall.This inaccurate prediction can lead to inappropriate decisions by the government, 
such as announcing a school closure, which can cause inconvenience to the public.The need of the hour is to develop a system that can accurately predict
rainfall and provide real-time information to the government, helping them make appropriate decisions.
